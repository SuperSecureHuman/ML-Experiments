# Image Segmentation with U-Net architecture

## Introduction

Image segmentation is a very common task in computer vision. It is a problem of finding the boundaries of objects in an image.

Note that the local dataset directory is not included in the repository, because it is around 30GB

I will be using the directory from another drive, and symlinking it here.

I augmented the image seperately, and stored the files seperately, then used it as dataset for training.

Currently, pytorch implementation is done. Will do tensorflow implementation later.
